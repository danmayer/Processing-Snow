#A small Ruby-Processing example merged together by Dan Mayer

What is it?

Where did this code come from?
I merged and modified two projects... 
The excellent, Slides, Code, and PDF from "Art of Code"
http://www.meetup.com/dcruby/messages/8233735/
A great example of Penrose Snowflake L-Systems using ruby-processing
http://learning-ruby-processing.blogspot.com/2009/11/penrose-snowflake-l-systems-using-ruby.html

What did you do?
I basically wanted to drawn randomly sized snowflakes of random complexity until the whole screen turned white. So taking the snowflake example that drew a single snowflake and modifying it to draw N snowflakes. I used code from the Art of Code presentation because it had nice loops, methods for screen capture, and a simple way to let the mouse restart the action.

Cool I want to make my own... Fork this project and play around or check out the Ruby-Processing getting started guide
http://wiki.github.com/jashkenas/ruby-processing/getting-started

How do I make this example work?
* sudo gem install ruby-processing
* rp5 run snow.rb
